In ES6 const keyword is used when the value you are going to assign is constant. Do not use const 
keyword if you have to reassign a value.

EX: const c="e";
    c="d"; 

EX: const s = [5, 7, 2];
    function editInPlace() {
  
    s[0]=2;
    s[1]=5;
    s[2]=7;

    }
    editInPlace();

This will give [2,5,7] as output.
