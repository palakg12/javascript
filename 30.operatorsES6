ES6 introduces the spread operator, which allows us to expand arrays and other expressions in places where multiple
parameters or elements are expected.
  EX:const arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
     const maximus = Math.max(...arr);
maximus would have a value of 89.



  EX:const arr1 = ['JAN', 'FEB', 'MAR', 'APR', 'MAY'];
     let arr2;
     arr2 = [...arr1];  // Change this line
     console.log(arr2);

This will copy the contents of arr1 into another array arr2
