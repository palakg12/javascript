Strings are immutable here ie.they cannot be altered once created.
 
 ex: let a = "Bob";
     a[0] = "J";      //this will give an error

Rather than doing it that way .Do it like this:
 ex: let a = "Bob";
     a = "Job";
As javascript is immutable so it will not take a single character.To change you have to change the whole changed 
string.
