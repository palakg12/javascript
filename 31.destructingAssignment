Destructuring assignment is special syntax introduced in ES6, for neatly assigning values taken directly from an object.

const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};
const {today,tomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES

GIVING VALUES :

const { name: userName, age: userAge } = user;
