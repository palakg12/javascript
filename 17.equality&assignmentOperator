(==):The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns true if 
they're equivalent or false if they are not. 



(=):Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value on the right of the operator to a
variable on the left.



(===):Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). However, unlike the equality operator, 
which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does 
not perform a type conversion.
If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator 
will return false.

3 == '3' returns true because JavaScript performs type conversion from string to number. 3 === '3' returns false 
because the types are different and type conversion is not performed.



(!==):inequality operator



(>):Greater than operator



(>=):The greater than or equal to operator 



(<):The less than operator 



(<=):The less than or equal to operator 


(&&):The logical and operator (&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.



(||):The logical or operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true. Otherwise, it returns false.
