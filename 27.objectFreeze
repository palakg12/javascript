const declaration alone doesn't really protect your data from mutation. To ensure your data doesn't change, 
JavaScript provides a function Object.freeze to prevent data mutation.

EX:  function freezeObj() {
     const MATH_CONSTANTS = {
     PI: 3.14
     };

     Object.freeze(MATH_CONSTANTS);
 
     try {
     MATH_CONSTANTS.PI = 99;
     } catch(ex) {
     console.log(ex);
     }
     return MATH_CONSTANTS.PI;
    }
    const PI = freezeObj();

This will return PI value as 3.14.
